/**
 * @file os_cb.c
 * @brief Template for the application-owned kernel callbacks (_cb functions).
 *
 * NOT part of the kernel build, and it must never be added to it: copy this file into the
 * application source tree as os_cb.c, add that copy to the application build, and adapt the
 * bodies to the product.
 *
 * This file holds the callbacks the APPLICATION owns, the ones whose answer is a product
 * decision rather than a fact about the chip: where a log line goes, what a failed assertion
 * does, how a blown stack is reported. Nothing here depends on the target.
 *
 * The other group is different in kind. Core id, the inter-core IPI, the kernel spinlock, the
 * tick timer, TrustZone banking and the tickless sleep hooks are all facts about the SoC, so a
 * SoC package under kernel/soc/ supplies them (see doc/soc.md). A target with no package copies
 * template/soc_cb.c into the application instead and fills it in by hand.
 *
 * Do NOT define that second group here as well. The kernel ships no default for it, so the
 * symbols are undefined until something supplies them - which is what makes the linker pull them
 * out of the SoC package. An empty stub in this file, compiled straight into the application,
 * defines the symbol before the linker ever looks in the package, so the package's real
 * implementation is never extracted and the stub wins in silence. On SMP that reads as every core
 * reporting id 0, which corrupts shared state rather than failing to build.
 *
 * Some of these are MANDATORY when their feature is enabled - the kernel declares them and
 * defines nothing, so a missing one is a link error rather than a silently empty hook. Each block
 * below says which it is. The #if guards match the exact condition under which the kernel calls
 * the group, in the same order as PART 2 of ahura.h and os_config.h, so the file compiles cleanly
 * under any configuration.
 *
 * Every definition here is WEAK, the same way a vendor startup file marks its interrupt handlers.
 * So there are two ways to work: edit a body in place, or leave this file exactly as it came and
 * put a normal (strong) definition of that one function anywhere else in the application - the
 * strong one wins at link time, with no duplicate-symbol error and nothing to delete here. Useful
 * when the natural home for a callback is the driver it belongs to, such as os_log_output_cb next
 * to the UART code.
 *
 * It costs none of the safety above. Weak or not, this file is still the ONLY definition of these
 * symbols, so forgetting to copy it into the build is still a link error naming exactly what is
 * missing.
